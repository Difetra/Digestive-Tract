- Determine water absorption rate of the intestines. Consider differentiating small and large intestine for absorption. May work in rudimentary osmolarity via metabolism hydration value. 

- Determine intestinal motility

- calculate transit time of intestines

	



## Advanced Features 

features that would enable more in depth simulation of the digestive process

- Simulate osmolarity to some degree to determine absorption and excretion of water. ([urine production](https://doctorlib.info/physiology/textbook-medical-physiology/28.html), [bowel absorption](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/73/suppl_2/57/1930269))
- intestinal motility based on fiber content, water intake, and calorie density.
